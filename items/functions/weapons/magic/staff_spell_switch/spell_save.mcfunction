# open a normal inventory ui where the unlock spells can be selected and added to the saved spells list.
# the order can be rearranged by selecting and unselecting different spells
# have a saved_spells scoreboard that stores the valeus accordingly
# there will be a max number of spells that can be saved (i.e. 5)
# if the staff being used has a hard set limit (i.e. 3) only use the first 3
# based on the number of spells change the scoreboard for the respective spell
